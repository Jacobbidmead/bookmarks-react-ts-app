a JavaScript web app that maintains a list of bookmarks (links).
The user is able to add/edit/delete any link in the list. The application
only uses front-end technologies (ie no backend database)

1.  Displays a form on the top of the page that lets a user submit a
    link.
2.  Displays the list of links with pagination so 20 links are shown per
    page.

3.  Users can remove links and clear all.
